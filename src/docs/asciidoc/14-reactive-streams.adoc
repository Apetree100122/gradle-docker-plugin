=== Reactive Streams

As needed, we will implement reactive methods as described in https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm[reactive-streams].
We implement these here as optional closures for all tasks.
Currently the only supported methods are `onError`, `onNext`, `onComplete`.
Various examples on how to use these can be found in our https://github.com/bmuschko/gradle-docker-plugin/blob/master/src/functTest/groovy/com/bmuschko/gradle/docker/DockerReactiveMethodsFunctionalTest.groovy[reactive tests]

[IMPORTANT]
The callbacks currently only work with Groovy DSL.

==== Reacting to an Error

The `onError` closure is passed the exception that is thrown for _you_ to handle.
If you silently ignore we will not throw the exception behind the scenes.
The below example is a common use-case that arises when someone wants to remove a container whether it exists or not but does not want to fail hard.

.build.gradle

==== Reacting to Data Returned by an Operation

The `onNext` closure is passed the next iterative response upon execution.
For all other tasks we simply hand you back the object that is given to us by `docker-java` which is a pojo representation of the json handed back by `docker`.
Thus, and much like the `onError` closure, all delegation is now in your control.
Any properties/values expected to be set will not be done unless _you_ do them.

Iterative tasks are things like `DockerBuildImage`, `DockerLogsContainer`, `DockerListImages`.
These tasks have output which can be iterated over.
The example below demonstrates how we iterate over each log message passing that to the closure for the user to work on.

==== Reacting to the Completion of an Operation

The `onComplete` closure is not passed anything upon execution.
It works in the same fashion that `doLast` does but is instead part of this task and thus executes before `doLast` does.
This closure executes _only_ upon success.
The below example demonstrates how this works.
